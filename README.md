# Myanmar Astronomy Horoscope
# မြန်မာ ရိုးရာ ဇာတာဖွဲ့

### Surya Siddhanta
### သူရိယသိဒ္ဓန္တ 

## Description

This project is a Myanmar Astronomy Horoscope App (မြန်မာ ရိုးရာ ဇာတာဖွဲ့ ဆော့ဝဲ).
The application is based on the theory of "Surya Siddhanta" (सूर्यसिद्धान्त) (သူရိယသိဒ္ဓန္တ), 
The Surya Siddhanta is an ancient Indian astronomical text that is highly significant in the history of astronomy.


An application originally developed in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) by Kaung Paing in 2002/2003. It is designed to generate astronomical horoscopes based on user input. This project has undergone several updates and is now being transitioned to open source, with ongoing work to migrate it to modern programming languages like Go, Swift, JavaScript and Python.

**Note**: It is strictly prohibited to publish and sell Chanditha calendars generated by this software.

### Key Features

- Utilizes the tangent function for astronomical calculations.
